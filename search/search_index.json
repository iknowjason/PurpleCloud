Faker is required for the following three scripts: azure_ad.py, ad.py, managed_identity.py. pip3 install faker Step 3: Environment Setup Set up your environment to use Terraform There are two ways to set up your environment in order to run terraform. Option 1: az login as Global Administrator Install the az cli tool. Type az login and follow the prompts to authenticate as a Global Administrator. This is the fastest way. Option 2: Create an Azure Service Principal Creating an Azure Service Principal and assigning it permissions is educational, but slower. After you have a valid Azure subscription, create an Azure Service Principal with the correct permissions and add the four environment variables to your local shell using .env or .envrc: export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=\"YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_VALUES\" export ARM_TENANT_ID=\"YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_VALUES\" export ARM_CLIENT_ID=\"YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_VALUES\" export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET=\"YOUR_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_VALUES\" Here are some references for creating a Service Principal to use with Azure.

This generator can be used to create a lab with Windows 10 Pro systems that automatically join to Azure Active Directory as managed devices showing in Azure AD. This can be used for security research into specific certificates for managed device registration and SSO tokens (PRT) that are used. Or general use cases such as exploring InTune and VDI deployments. The script allows you to pass parameters specifying how many Windows 10 systems to create. It requires a minimum of 1 endpoint in order to run. It also creates Azure AD users that can be used to login to the VM. Ten (10) Azure AD users are randomly generated by default but you can specify more. The role of Virtual Machine Administrator Login and Virtual Machine User Login is attached to all users. This is the classic use case and benefit of Windows 10/11 managed devices, using hybrid Identity and a single set of credentials in Azure AD to log into the VM. A System Assigned identity is automatically attached to all VMs, but you can also specify a User Assigned Identity with a specific role that you desire. Minimum Parameters Required You must pass two parameters to run the script. The domain or UPN suffix and the number of VMs to build. --upn <upn_suffix_domain> --endpoints <vm_count> Important Note This generator lives in the generators/aadjoin directory. Navigate into this directory first. cd generators/aadjoin Usage Examples Example 1: Basic Azure AD Join lab python3 aadjoin.py --upn rtcfingroup.com --endpoints 1 Description: This will generate a single Windows 10 system that is joined to the Azure Active Directory domain based on the tenant authenticated with the Service Principal. Ten (10) Azure AD users will be created in the Azure AD tenant specified by the UPN ( --upn ). In this example the users will be created with rtcfingroup.com as their UPN suffix. The following resources will be created, including terraform files and user output files. The default roles will be assigned to all Azure AD Users: Virtual Machine Administrator Login, Virtual Machine User Login. These can be customized in the roles.tf output file or in the python script. main_aadjoin.tf: Terraform file with resource group and location. network_aadjoin.tf: Terraform file with VNet and subnets. nsg_aadjoin.tf: Terraform file with Network Security Groups. providers.tf: Terraform file containing terraform providers. sysmon.tf: Terraform file containing sysmon configuration. win10-1.tf: Terraform file with Windows 10 Pro configuration. users.tf: Terraform file that will build the Azure AD users. roles.tf: Terraform file that will assign the role to all Azure AD users. azure_users.csv: A csv including the Azure AD user's full name, username, and email address. azure_usernames.txt: A file including just the usernames. azure_emails.txt: A file including just the email addresses. Example 2: Azure AD Join lab with 30 users and 3 VMs python3 aadjoin.py --upn rtcfingroup.com --endpoints 3 --count 30 Description: Same as above, except generate 30 users in Azure AD and create three (3) Windows 10 Virtual Machines that will perform an Azure AD Join. Running terraform apply will generate a random password shared by all users. The password applied to all users will be displayed at the end of terraform apply . To display the passwor again, run terraform output . Example 3: Azure AD Join lab with a User Assigned Identity python3 aadjoin.py --upn rtcfingroup.com --endpoints 3 --count 30 --user_identity reader Description: Same as above, except add a User Assigned Identity on all VMs with a role of Reader on the subscription. Possible values for the role are reader, contributor, and owner. Details RDP Access & Cheat Sheet for VM Remote Access All of the VMs can be accessed over RDP. The Azure NSGs should already be white listed to only allow a connection from your IP address. You can run terraform apply to update this. Here is a sample output on the RDP Cheat Sheet that gives you the exact commands from a standard Ubuntu Linux to RDP to each VM with the Azure AD credentials: RDP Cheatsheet for Azure AD Login --------------------------------- xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\chasemiller@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\arielparsons@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\michaelbarnett@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\brandongonzalez@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\jessicafields@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\brittanyriddle@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\rebeccaperry@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\josephedwards@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\christopherandersen@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 xfreerdp --no-nla -u \"AzureAD\\kevinmiller@rtcfingroup.com\" -p \"cosmic-stingray-96W-r\" --ignore-certificate 20.124.129.181 Advanced Command Line --count <num_of_aad_users> : The number of Azure AD users to automatically build (Default: 10) --upn : The upn suffix or domain name used to create Azure AD users (Default: Disabled) --endpoints <num_of_endpoints> : Number of Windows 10 Professional systems to build (Default: 0) --resource_group <rg_name> : Name of the Azure resource group to automatically create (Default: PurpleCloud) --location <location> : The Azure location to use (Default: eastus) --admin <admin_username> : The Local Administrator account (Default: RTCAdmin) --password <password> : The local Administrator password and default AD user password (Default: auto generate a strong password) --user_identity : The User Assigned Identity to assign to each VM.

For this reason we have added a logging feature that captures all passwords created. The ad.py script will automatically log all output to a logfile called ranges.log . This is for the specific purpose of being able to track the ranges created and the passwords that are auto-generated for AD users and local Administrator accounts. You can also type terraform output as a secondary way to get the password and details for each virtual machine. Azure Network Security Groups: By default, a terraform data http resource will auto-detect your public IP address using a request to http://ifconfig.me. Your public IP address will be used to white list the Azure NSG source prefix setting. If you change locations and your IP address changes, simply type terraform apply and the NSG white-listed public IP address should update through terraform. locals { src_ip = chomp(data.http.firewall_allowed.response_body) #src_ip = \"0.0.0.0/0\" } Outputs: After the terraform resources are applied and build, you can type terraform output to get some important information such as the public IP address of VMs in addition to local Administrator credentials and Azure AD Login over RDP.

Important Note This generator lives in the generators/ad directory. Navigate into this directory first. cd generators/ad Usage Examples Example 1: One Windows 10 Endpoint with Sysmon installed python3 ad.py --endpoint 1 Description: This will generate a single Windows 10 Endpoint and generate a random, unique password with a default local Administrator account named RTCAdmin . This generates the following terraform files: main.tf: Terraform file with resource group and location. network.tf: Terraform file with VNet and subnets. nsg.tf: Terraform file with Network Security Groups. providers.tf: Terraform file containing terraform providers. sysmon.tf: Terraform file containing sysmon configuration. win10-1.tf: Terraform file with Windows 10 Pro configuration. Example 2: Domain Controller with Forest and Users + Windows Domain Join (Randomly Generate Users) python3 ad.py --domain_controller --ad_domain rtcfingroup.com --admin RTCAdmin --password MyPassword012345 --ad_users 500 --endpoints 2 --domain_join Description: This will create a Domain Controller in dc.tf and install AD DS with forest name of rtcfingroup.com . This will create a custom local administrator account and password with 500 domain users. In this example, the domain users are randomly generated using the command line flag of --ad_users for a total of 500 users. The domain users will be written to ad_users.csv and will have the password specified in --password. Note that domain join is disabled by default for Windows 10 Pro but the domain_join parameter enables it for all Windows 10 Pro created. This will also create two Windows 10 Pro terraform files (win10-1.tf, win10-2.tf) as well as a terraform file for the Domain Controller (dc.tf). Example 3: Domain Controller with Forest and Users + Windows Domain Join (Import Custom Users from CSV) python3 ad.py --domain_controller --ad_domain rtcfingroup.com --admin RTCAdmin --password MyPassword012345 --csv users.csv --endpoints 2 --domain_join Description: Same capabilities as above, except it can import a custom list of Domain Users into active directory on the DC instance. The script checks to make sure that users are in the correct format. An example CSV showing five users is listed below: name,upn,password,groups,oupath,domain_admin Lars Borgerson,larsborgerson@rtcfingroup.com,MyPassword012345,IT,OU=IT;DC=rtcfingroup;DC=com,False Olivia Odinsdottir,oliviaodinsdottir@rtcfingroup.com,MyPassword012345,IT,OU=IT;DC=rtcfingroup;DC=com,True Liem Anderson,liemanderson@rtcfingroup.com,MyPassword012345,IT,OU=IT;DC=rtcfingroup;DC=com,False John Nilsson,johnnilsson@rtcfingroup.com,MyPassword012345,IT,OU=IT;DC=rtcfingroup;DC=com,False Jason Lindqvist,jasonlindqvist@rtcfingroup.com,MyPassword012345,IT,OU=IT;DC=rtcfingroup;DC=com,True Example 4: Build a Veloicraptor + Hunting ELK server and automatically export sysmon winlog beat logs python3 ad.py --helk --endpoint 1 Description: This will add a Velociraptor + Hunting ELK server with one Windows 10 Endpoint. The winlogbeat agent will be installed on Windows 10 Pro and the logs will be sent to the HELK server. Velociraptor will be installed on the HELK server and the Velociraptor agent on Windows 10 Pro. The endpoint will automatically register to the Velociraptor server running on HELK. This will create a terraform file for the HELK server (helk.tf) Default OS and Application Credentials: OS username: helk. HELK Username: admin. Can be changed in local.vadmin_username . HELK Password: Randomly generated. Can be changed in local.vadmin_password . Velociraptor Username: admin. Can be changed in local.vadmin_username . Velociraptor Password: Randomly generated. Can be changed in local.vadmin_password . Accessing Credentials and Application URLs: After the range has built, type terraform output to get the credentials and URLs for HELK and Velociraptor. Input Files for Velociraptor + HELK: The following files are automatically uploaded to storage container and then downloaded by the HELk + Velociraptor system. They can be fully customized to suit your needs. Files found in shared directory Sysmon.zip: The sysmon version to be used on Windows 10 endpoints. This version is v14.0. This file is in the shared directory from the default project directory: shared/Sysmon.zip . velociraptor-v0.6.5-2-linux-amd64.gz: The velociraptor linux binary that runs on the server. velociraptor-v0.6.5-2-windows-amd64.msi: The velociraptor msi that runs on windows 10 endpoints. winlogbeat-7.9.2-windows-x86_64.zip: The winlogbeat agent that runs on windows 10 endpoints and ships logs to the HELK server. Files found in files/velocihelk directory sysmonconfig-export.xml: The sysmon configuration to be used. Currently uses github.com/SwiftOnSecurity. helk.sh.tpl: The script used to help build the Hunting ELK (HELK) server. winlogbeat.yml.tpl: The configuration file for winlogbeat agent that currently sends to HELK using kafka transport. config.yaml.tpl: The velociraptor configuration file used to build the internal PKI. This is used on the server and client agents. Details There are a few important files that are used in the range that are automatically uploaded and downloaded to resources. They can be easily customized. Sysmon.zip: This range includes Sysmon version 14. It lives in shared/Sysmon.zip . This file gets pushed to a storage container where all Windows 10 endpoints download it. You can replace it for customizations. AzureADConnect.msi: This range includes version 2.x of AzureADConnect MSI installer. It lives in shared/AzureADConnect.msi . This file gets pushed to a storage container where the DC downloads it to the local Administrator desktop. You can replace it for customizations. sysmonconfig-export.xml: The sysmon configuration file gets uploaded to a storage container and downloaded by all Windows 10 endpoints. It lives in files/sysmon/sysmonconfig-export.xml . Advanced Command Line --resource_group <rg_name> : Name of the Azure resource group to automatically create (Default: PurpleCloud) --location <location> : The Azure location to use (Default: eastus) --endpoints <num_of_endpoints> : Number of Windows 10 Professional systems to build (Default: 0) --helk : Create a hunting ELK server (with Velociraptor installed) (Default: Disabled) --domain_controller : Create a Domain Controller and install AD DS with Forest (Default: Disabled) --ad_domain <domain> : The name of the AD Domain to provision (Default: rtc.local) --ad_users <num_of_domain_users> : The number of AD users to automatically build (Default: Disabled) --csv <csv_file> : A custom CSV file to use that will load domain users on the DC's AD DS (Default: Disabled) --admin <admin_username> : The Local Administrator account (Default: RTCAdmin) --password <password> : The local Administrator password and default AD user password (Default: auto generate a strong password) --domain_join : Join the Windows 10 Pro systems to the AD Domain (Default: false) --auto_logon : Automatically logon the domain user with their credentials upon system start (Default: false) How AD Builds on the DC Some notes I've gathered on AD usage and building. Azure AD Connect: The Azure AD connect MSI is included in ths repo. It can be upgraded by replacing the file in shared/AzureADConnect.msi . The current version is 2.x of AD Connect. The file is uploaded to the storage container and then downloaded to the local Administrator's desktop. The bootstrap script for building Active Directory is contained in files/dc/bootstrap-dc.ps1.tpl . This script is used to build AD DS on the dc instance created in dc.tf. After terraform runs, the actual rendered dc bootstrap script (with variables) is output to output/dc/bootstrap-dc1.ps1. For troubleshooting you can copy that script to the DC and run it. The way AD users, groups, and OUs are added: In the CSV file, there is a field for oupath . The string for the OU= is looked at and a new OU is created if it hasn't already. This is the way new OUs can be added. AD users are added to that specific OU when they are created. For adding AD Groups, the CSV field for groups is examined. The user is added into that AD group. The groups and OU= portion of the oupath should match. If they don't, problems could arise adding the user. The ad_users.csv file is the name of the file that the DC uses to build AD. It is uploaded to the storage container that is created and downloaded automatically by the DC. Look in C:\\terraform\\ad_users.csv to look at this file if needed. When using the --csv <file1> to specify your own AD users CSV, how this works: That file is copied to ad_users.csv and it is uploaded to the storage container, and downloaded to the DC. Same as above, it is copied into C:\\terraform\\ad_users.csv where the bootstrap script parses it. For auto_logon domain users: An AD domain user is randomly selected for logging on that Windows 10 Pro endpoint. To customize which domain user is used, you can manually edit the windows 10 terraform file (i.e., win10-1.tf). Edit script options in ad.py Windows 10 Pro configuration: The Windows 10 Pro default configuration can be adjusted to meet your needs. These are located in the config_win10_endpoints dictionary: hostname_base: The base Windows 10 hostname (Default: win10) join_domain: Whether to join the Windows 10 Pro to the AD Domain. This is disabled by default. So if you add a DC and want to join the Windows 10 Pro systems to the AD Domain, you can set this to true. Or you can use the command line parameter --domain-join . auto_logon_domain_users: Configure the endpoint (via registry) to automatically log in the domain user. This will randomly select an AD user. Disabled by default and requires domain join and DC. install_sysmon: Automatically install Sysmon with Swift on Security configuration (Default: Enabled) install_art: Install Atomic Red Team (art). (Default: Enabled) config_win10_endpoint = { \"hostname_base\":\"win10\", \"join_domain\":\"false\", \"auto_logon_domain_user\":\"false\", \"install_sysmon\":sysmon_endpoint_config, \"install_art\":\"true\", } Default AD Users: There is a python dictionary specifying the default AD users. This can be changed to suit your needs. These are the first five users automaticaly created. After the first five, users are randomly generated to meet the --ad_users <number> amount. Here is the default_ad_users list along with the first user, that can be searched for in the file: default_ad_users = [ { \"name\":\"Lars Borgerson\", \"ou\": \"CN=users,DC=rtc,DC=local\", \"password\": get_password(), \"domain_admin\":\"\", \"groups\":\"IT\" }, Network Subnets configuration: The configuration for the subnets can be adjusted in the python list named config_subnets . Some changes include changing the default subnet names or adding/removing subnets. By default there are four subnets created. Other Details: ranges.log: The ranges.log file writes out important information as the range is built, such as VM details. You can use it to track things. Logging Passwords: By default, all passwords are randomly generated. So if you are not aware of this, it might be easy to lose track of a password. For this reason we have added a logging feature that captures all passwords created. The ad.py script will automatically log all output to a logfile called ranges.log . This is for the specific purpose of being able to track the ranges created and the passwords that are auto-generated for AD users and local Administrator accounts. You can also type terraform output as a secondary way to get the password and details for each virtual machine. Azure Network Security Groups: By default, the ad.py script will try to auto-detect your public IP address using a request to http://ifconfig.me. Your public IP address will be used to white list the Azure NSG source prefix setting. A second terraform resource is then used to manage and update any changes to your public IP address. You can hard code a different IP address in the following section of the ad.py script or the terraform nsg.tf file. If you change locations and your IP address changes, simply type terraform apply and the NSG white-listed public IP address should update through terraform. locals { src_ip = chomp(data.http.firewall_allowed.response_body) #src_ip = \"0.0.0.0/0\" } Outputs: After the terraform resources are applied and build, you can type terraform output to get some important information such as the public IP address of VMs in addition to credentials for OS and applications. Terraform Outputs You can get the details of each Virtual Machine, including passwords, by typing terraform output .

This generator can create an enterprise ADFS server deployment with a Domain Controller. It can also add a full domain-joined enterprise Active Directory environment with users and Windows 10 Professional endpoints. This generator always adds a Microsoft Sentinel deployment with a Log Analytics workspace. The ADFS server automatically installs the Azure legacy monitoring agent with Sysmon and ADFS security auditing configuration, and will ship the logs into Sentinel via the agent. For each Windows 10 Pro system added, they will all have Sysmon installed, the legacy monitoring agent, and ship Sysmon logs to Sentinel. Default Resources To summarize, the following Azure resources are always created by default with this lab: One ADFS server joined to an AD Domain One DC One Sentinel deployment Important Note This generator lives in the generators/adfs directory. Navigate into this directory first. cd generators/adfs Manual Logging Configuration To properly view the Sysmon and Windows event logs for security within Sentinel, it is necessary to take a few steps to configure the ADFS server and each Windows 10 system. After terraform runs, follow these steps to view logs in Sentinel. Step 1: Add Sysmon Channel in log analytics agents configuration Navigate into the log analytics workspace and agents configuration . Select the add windows event log . Type Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational into the Log name input field and select Apply. The following screen shot shows how the configuration should look. Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational Step 2: Enable the Sentinel Data Connector - \"Security Events via Legacy Agent\" Navigate into Sentinel. Find Data connectors under Configuration . In the search field or by scrolling below, find the connector named Security Events via Legacy Agent . Select open the connector page in the lower right hand corner. Select Common under which events to stream and Apply changes. Verify that the connector shows a green highlight and shows connected, as shown below. Step 3: Reboot Virtual Machines and Verify connected in Agents Management Verify that ADFS and all Windows 10 Virtual machines show as connected. Verify this by navigating into the Log Analytics workspace and looking under Agents management under settings . Reboot each of the Azure Virtual Machines and then look to verify that they all list a connected status. It should look like the following screen shot shown below. After the Virtual Machines reboot, you can navigate into the Sentinel overview page and start to see new Sysmon and Windows security event logs in the Overview. The Sysmon logs will show under EVENT table while the security event logs will show under the SECURITYEVENT table. Usage Examples Example 1: One ADFS Server and one Domain Controller, with self-signed ADFS certificate python3 adfds.py Description: This will generate a lab with a single ADFS server and Domain Controller. The ADFS server will use a self-signed certificate. Five AD users will be created with a default AD domain of rtc.local . This generates the following terraform files: adfs.tf: Terraform file defining ADFS configuration. dc_adfs.tf: Terraform file defining the Domain Controller configuration. main_adfs.tf: Terraform file with resource group and location. network_adfs.tf: Terraform file with VNet and subnets. nsg_adfs.tf: Terraform file with Network Security Groups. providers.tf: Terraform file containing terraform providers. sentinel_adfs.tf: Terraform file with Network Security Groups. storage_adfs.tf: Terraform file containing sysmon and all other files used for configuration. In addition to the above terraform files, a single file will be created with five AD users: ad_users.csv Example 2: ADFS Server with DC. The ADFS Server will import a trusted, CA signed certificate. python3 adfs.py --trusted_cert adfs.pfx --pfx_password password --ad_domain rtcsecurity.net Description: This will build an ADFS server and DC as described in example 1. In this example, a trusted, CA signed certificate is imported. The name of the certificate is passed in the parameter --trusted_cert . The format of the file is pfx, and the password used to protect the file is passed in the parameter --pfx_password . Finally, an AD Domain used to create AD is specified in the --ad_domain . The Azure Simuland project has a great guide on how to get a trusted CA signed SSL certificate: https://github.com/Azure/SimuLand/blob/main/docs/environments/_helper-docs/getTrustedCASignedSSLCertificate.md Example 3: ADFS + DC + Adding Windows 10 Professional (Randomly generate AD users) python3 adfs.py --ad_domain rtcfingroup.com --admin RTCAdmin --password MyPassword012345 --endpoints 1 --domain_join --ad_users 500 Description: This example builds an Active Directory domain of rtcfingroup.com on the DC. The ADFS server automatically joins to this AD domain and a self-signed certificate will be used to build ADFS. With --endpoints 1 , one Windows 10 Pro system is created and it is set to join the domain with --domain_join . Finally, 500 AD users are randomly generated and added to the AD Domain, with assignment into AD Groups and OUs that are also created. Example 4: ADFS + DC + Adding Windows 10 Professional (Import Custom Users from CSV) python3 adfs.py --ad_domain rtcfingroup.com --admin RTCAdmin --password MyPassword012345 --csv users.csv --endpoints 1 --domain_join --ad_users 500 Description: Same capabilities as above, except it can import a custom list of Domain Users into active directory on the DC instance. With the --csv users.csv , a file named users.csv is looked for in the working directory. The script checks to make sure that users are in the correct format.

They can be easily customized. Sysmon.zip: This range includes Sysmon version 14. It lives in shared/Sysmon.zip . This file gets pushed to a storage container where the ADFS server and all Windows 10 endpoints download it. You can replace it for customizations. AzureADConnect.msi: This range includes version 2.x of AzureADConnect MSI installer. It lives in shared/AzureADConnect.msi . This file gets pushed to a storage container where the ADFS server and DC both download it to the local Administrator desktop. You can replace it for customizations. sysmonconfig-export.xml: The sysmon configuration file gets uploaded to a storage container and downloaded by the ADFS server and all Windows 10 endpoints. It lives in files/sysmon/sysmonconfig-export.xml .

The location of these scripts is files/adfs . What the files do: bootstrap-adfs.ps1.tpl: This is the main script that installs symon. It downloads the install_adfs.ps1 script from the storage container and the domain_join.ps1 script from the storage container. If the domain_join setting is true, it will set up a powershell scheduled job to launch the domain_join.ps1 script. domain_join.ps1.tpl: This joins the system to the AD domain. It runs as a Powershell Scheduled Job and should de-register after domain join is detected as true. install_adfs.ps1.tpl: Installs the ADFS components and services. It will by default generate a self-signed certificate. If the trusted, CA signed certificate option is enabled, it will download the certificate from the storage container. Finally, it configures ADFS Security auditing log configuration. How AD Builds on the DC Some notes I've gathered on AD usage and building. Azure AD Connect: The Azure AD connect MSI is included in ths repo. It can be upgraded by replacing the file in shared/AzureADConnect.msi . The current version is 2.x of AD Connect.

Azure AD Connect: The Azure AD connect MSI is included in ths repo. It can be upgraded by replacing the file in shared/AzureADConnect.msi . The current version is 2.x of AD Connect. The file is uploaded to the storage container and then downloaded to the local Administrator's desktop. The bootstrap script for building Active Directory is contained in files/dc/bootstrap-dc.ps1.tpl . This script is used to build AD DS on the dc instance created in dc.tf. After terraform runs, the actual rendered dc bootstrap script (with variables) is output to output/dc/bootstrap-dc1.ps1. For troubleshooting you can copy that script to the DC and run it. The way AD users, groups, and OUs are added: In the CSV file, there is a field for oupath . The string for the OU= is looked at and a new OU is created if it hasn't already. This is the way new OUs can be added. AD users are added to that specific OU when they are created. For adding AD Groups, the CSV field for groups is examined. The user is added into that AD group. The groups and OU= portion of the oupath should match. If they don't, problems could arise adding the user. The ad_users.csv file is the name of the file that the DC uses to build AD. It is uploaded to the storage container that is created and downloaded automatically by the DC. Look in C:\\terraform\\ad_users.csv to look at this file if needed. When using the --csv <file1> to specify your own AD users CSV, how this works: That file is copied to ad_users.csv and it is uploaded to the storage container, and downloaded to the DC. Same as above, it is copied into C:\\terraform\\ad_users.csv where the bootstrap script parses it.

These are located in the config_win10_endpoints dictionary: hostname_base: The base Windows 10 hostname (Default: win10) join_domain: Whether to join the Windows 10 Pro to the AD Domain. This is disabled by default. So if you add a DC and want to join the Windows 10 Pro systems to the AD Domain, you can set this to true. Or you can use the command line parameter --domain-join . auto_logon_domain_users: Configure the endpoint (via registry) to automatically log in the domain user. This will randomly select an AD user.

So if you are not aware of this, it might be easy to lose track of a password. For this reason we have added a logging feature that captures all passwords created. The ad.py script will automatically log all output to a logfile called ranges.log . This is for the specific purpose of being able to track the ranges created and the passwords that are auto-generated for AD users and local Administrator accounts.

Optionally configure a Domain Controller with Domain Join. Windows 10 Azure VMs automatically install and configure the legacy Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) or Operations Management Suite (OMS) and send logs to the Log Analytics workspace. The endpoints will install Sysmon by default. Note that some manual configuration steps are required for final logging configuration. Important Note This generator lives in the generators/sentinel directory. Navigate into this directory first. cd generators/sentinel Manual Logging Configuration After creating the lab there are a couple of manual setup steps required. Step 1: Add Sysmon Channel in log analytics agents configuration Navigate into the log analytics workspace and agents configuration . Select the add windows event log . Type Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational into the Log name input field and select Apply. The following screen shot shows how the configuration should look. Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational Step 2: Enable the Sentinel Data Connector - \"Security Events via Legacy Agent\" Navigate into Sentinel. Find Data connectors under Configuration . In the search field or by scrolling below, find the connector named Security Events via Legacy Agent . Select open the connector page in the lower right hand corner. Select Common under which events to stream and Apply changes. Verify that the connector shows a green highlight and shows connected, as shown below. Step 3: Reboot Virtual Machines and Verify connected in Agents Management Verify that all Windows 10 Virtual machines show as connected. Verify this by navigating into the Log Analytics workspace and looking under Agents management under settings . Reboot each of the Azure Virtual Machines and then look to verify that they all list a connected status. It should look like the following screen shot shown below. Note: When configuring Domain Join with Active Directory, the Azure Windows 10 Professional machines will automatically reboot after joining the domain, so no manual reboot is necessary. After the Virtual Machines reboot, you can navigate into the Sentinel overview page and start to see new Sysmon and Windows security event logs in the Overview. The Sysmon logs will show under EVENT table while the security event logs will show under the SECURITYEVENT table. Usage Examples Example 1: Simple Microsoft Sentinel lab python3 sentinel.py This generates a Microsoft Sentinel lab with a Log Analytics workspace. This generates a terraform format HCL file for sentinel.tf and providers.tf . -l <LOCATION> : Specify a different location (Default: eastus) -odc : Optionally enables the Office 365 data connector for Sentinel. -adc : Optionally enables the Azure AD data connector for Sentinel. Example 2: One Windows 10 Endpoint with Sysmon installed This generates a single Windows 10 Endpoint with Sysmon installed. python3 sentinel.py --endpoint 1 All Windows 10 Pro systems will automatically send logs to Sentinel. Some small manual steps are required (listed above) to get Sysmon and Security logs properly working. Example 3: Domain Controller with Forest and Users + Windows Domain Join (Randomly Generate Users) python3 sentinel.py --domain_controller --ad_domain rtcfingroup.com --admin RTCAdmin --password MyPassword012345 --ad_users 500 --endpoints 2 --domain_join Description: This will automatically create an Microsoft Sentinel deployment. This will also create a Domain Controller in dc_sentinel.tf and install AD DS with forest name of rtcfingroup.com. This will create a custom local administrator account and password with 500 domain users. In this example, the domain users are randomly generated using the command line flag of --ad_users for a total of 500 users. The domain users will be written to ad_users.csv and will have the password specified in --password. Note that domain join is disabled by default for Windows 10 Pro but the domain_join parameter enables it for all Windows 10 Pro created. This will also create two Windows 10 Pro terraform files (win10-1.tf, win10-2.tf) as well as a terraform file for the Domain Controller (dc_sentinel.tf). For the two Windows 10 Pro endpoints, they will be configured with the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) to ship logs to Log Analytics Workspace with Microsoft Sentinel.

It lives in files/sysmon/sysmonconfig-export.xml . Advanced Command Line --resource_group <rg_name> : Name of the Azure resource group to automatically create (Default: PurpleCloud) --location <location> : The Azure location to use (Default: eastus) --endpoints <num_of_endpoints> : Number of Windows 10 Professional systems to build (Default: 0) --domain_controller : Create a Domain Controller and install AD DS with Forest (Default: Disabled) --ad_domain <domain> : The name of the AD Domain to provision (Default: rtc.local) --ad_users <num_of_domain_users> : The number of AD users to automatically build (Default: Disabled) --csv <csv_file> : A custom CSV file to use that will load domain users on the DC's AD DS (Default: Disabled) --admin <admin_username> : The Local Administrator account (Default: RTCAdmin) --password <password> : The local Administrator password and default AD user password (Default: auto generate a strong password) --domain_join : Join the Windows 10 Pro systems to the AD Domain (Default: false) --auto_logon : Automatically logon the domain user with their credentials upon system start (Default: false) How AD Builds on the DC Some notes I've gathered on AD usage and building. Azure AD Connect: The Azure AD connect MSI is included in ths repo. It can be upgraded by replacing the file in shared/AzureADConnect.msi . The current version is 2.x of AD Connect. The file is uploaded to the storage container and then downloaded to the local Administrator's desktop. The bootstrap script for building Active Directory is contained in files/dc/bootstrap-dc.ps1.tpl . This script is used to build AD DS on the dc instance created in dc.tf. After terraform runs, the actual rendered dc bootstrap script (with variables) is output to output/dc/bootstrap-dc1.ps1. For troubleshooting you can copy that script to the DC and run it. The ad_users.csv file is the name of the file that the DC uses to build AD. It is uploaded to the storage container that is created and downloaded automatically by the DC. Look in C:\\terraform\\ad_users.csv to look at this file if needed. When using the --csv <file1> to specify your own AD users CSV, how this works: That file is copied to ad_users.csv and it is uploaded to the storage container, and downloaded to the DC. Same as above, it is copied into C:\\terraform\\ad_users.csv where the bootstrap script parses it. For auto_logon domain users: An AD domain user is randomly selected for logging on that Windows 10 Pro endpoint. To customize which domain user is used, you can manually edit the windows 10 terraform file (i.e., win10-1.tf). Edit script options in sentinel.py Windows 10 Pro configuration: The Windows 10 Pro default configuration can be adjusted to meet your needs. These are located in the config_win10_endpoints dictionary: hostname_base: The base Windows 10 hostname (Default: win10) join_domain: Whether to join the Windows 10 Pro to the AD Domain. This is disabled by default. So if you add a DC and want to join the Windows 10 Pro systems to the AD Domain, you can set this to true. Or you can use the command line parameter --domain-join . auto_logon_domain_users: Configure the endpoint (via registry) to automatically log in the domain user. This will randomly select an AD user. Disabled by default and requires domain join and DC. install_sysmon: Automatically install Sysmon with Swift on Security configuration (Default: Enabled) install_art: Install Atomic Red Team (art). (Default: Enabled) config_win10_endpoint = { \"hostname_base\":\"win10\", \"join_domain\":\"false\", \"auto_logon_domain_user\":\"false\", \"install_sysmon\":sysmon_endpoint_config, \"install_art\":\"true\", } Default AD Users: There is a python dictionary specifying the default AD users. This can be changed to suit your needs. These are the first five users automaticaly created. After the first five, users are randomly generated to meet the --ad_users <number> amount. Here is the default_ad_users list along with the first user, that can be searched for in the file: default_ad_users = [ { \"name\":\"Lars Borgerson\", \"ou\": \"CN=users,DC=rtc,DC=local\", \"password\": get_password(), \"domain_admin\":\"\", \"groups\":\"IT\" }, Network Subnets configuration: The configuration for the subnets can be adjusted in the python list named config_subnets . Some changes include changing the default subnet names or adding/removing subnets. By default there are four subnets created. Other Details: ranges.log: The ranges.log file writes out important information as the range is built, such as VM details. You can use it to track things. Logging Passwords: By default, all passwords are randomly generated. So if you are not aware of this, it might be easy to lose track of a password. For this reason we have added a logging feature that captures all passwords created. The ad.py script will automatically log all output to a logfile called ranges.log . This is for the specific purpose of being able to track the ranges created and the passwords that are auto-generated for AD users and local Administrator accounts. You can also type terraform output as a secondary way to get the password and details for each virtual machine. Azure Network Security Groups: By default, the ad.py script will try to auto-detect your public IP address using a request to http://ifconfig.me. Your public IP address will be used to white list the Azure NSG source prefix setting. A second terraform resource is then used to manage and update any changes to your public IP address. You can hard code a different IP address in the following section of the ad.py script or the terraform nsg.tf file. If you change locations and your IP address changes, simply type terraform apply and the NSG white-listed public IP address should update through terraform. locals { src_ip = chomp(data.http.firewall_allowed.response_body) #src_ip = \"0.0.0.0/0\" } Outputs: After the terraform resources are applied and build, you can type terraform output to get some important information such as the public IP address of VMs in addition to credentials for OS. Terraform Outputs You can get the details of each Virtual Machine, including passwords, by typing terraform output .
